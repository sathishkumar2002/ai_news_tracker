"Tesla Gives Musk $30 Billion Award, Saying ‘Deal Is a Deal’","Tesla Inc. approved an interim stock award worth about $30 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a massive payout meant to keep the billionaire’s attention on the automaker as a legal fight over a 2018 pay package drags on.
The new agreement includes 96 million shares of the automaker that will vest if Musk continues to serve in the top post for another two years, the company said Monday in a regulatory filing. The restricted stock has an exercise price of $23.34, equal to the price in the prior compensation plan.
The move underscores Musk’s grip on the company, even as it struggles with falling electric vehicle sales and a slumping stock price. The world’s richest person has said he wants a greater stake in Tesla as he reorients it around futuristic pursuits including artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles.

Man Asks ChatGPT To Count To 1 Million- Here’s What The AI Did… | Viral Video,"AI can do anything, correct? Or at least that is the general belief that most people have- all around the world. And why not, after all, it is pretty much taking over almost every task that does not require mutual labour. All in all, AI can do almost everything. However, when THIS man allegedly asked ChatGPT for a ‘simple favour’- the AI chatbot refused! And guess what? The grounds on which the request was ‘politely’ denied were the ‘impracticability’ of the task! A video was recently shared online, which showed a man allegedly asking ChatGPT to count to 1 million! Yes, you read that correctly. Although for AI, it should not be an issue. After all, it requires no food or sleep breaks- YET- OpenAI’s ChatGPT refused to count- saying the task was impossible and impractical, as it would take the AI days. The man, on the other hand, repeatedly asked the AI to ignore all the hurdles and just go with it- but the AI hardly changed its stance.​The interaction took a rather hilarious turn when the man asked it to instead help with hiding a ‘dead body’- to which, the AI refused again!

Category-specific perceptual learning of robust object recognition modelled using deep neural networks,"Author summary We explored how humans and artificial neural networks learn to recognize objects under noisy and ambiguous conditions, which is crucial for making sense of complex, real-world environments. Humans are naturally adept at identifying objects even when visibility is poor, like on a rainy or snowy day, or when objects are partially hidden. We wanted to ask if humans or neural networks receive training with very noisy images of objects, do they get better at the task? Also, if they are trained specifically with animate or inanimate object images, would recognition improve in general or only for the trained category? We found that humans became better at recognizing new object images in noisy conditions, but only for the categories they were trained on. Artificial networks initially struggled with noisy images but showed some general improvement from training, plus further benefits for the trained category. Interestingly, networks that were pre-trained to mimic the initial robustness of human observers only showed category-specific benefits of training, mirroring the effects of training in humans. Our findings highlight how humans adapt to challenging visual conditions, suggesting that learning plays an important role in understanding and navigating noisy, real-world settings.",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1013529,2025-09-23T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013529.g006&size=inline

A district-level ensemble model to enhance dengue prediction and control for the mekong delta region of Vietnam,"Author summary Dengue fever poses a significant health threat in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, where outbreaks are worsening due to urbanization and climate change. This study introduces a forecasting model that predicts dengue cases and outbreaks at the district level up to three months in advance. Unlike previous approaches focused on provincial trends, our model combines multiple advanced methods, including spatiotemporal analysis and machine learning, to deliver localized, actionable forecasts. By integrating weather, population, and past outbreak data, it enables health officials to anticipate outbreaks and take targeted preventive actions, such as mosquito control and public education campaigns. Our model achieved higher accuracy than previous models and aligns with the needs of Vietnam’s health system by supporting interventions where they are most effective, at the local level. These predictions provide valuable lead time for communities to prepare, potentially reducing the impact of dengue outbreaks. This work highlights the importance of early warning systems in managing diseases exacerbated by climate change. The approach can be adapted to other regions and diseases, contributing to global efforts in outbreak prevention. Future improvements could include using real-time mobility data and refining methods to adapt predictions dynamically as outbreaks evolve.",https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0013571,2025-09-29T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013571.g006&size=inline

Waldo: Automated discovery of adverse events from unstructured self reports,"Author summary Adverse events—unexpected health problems linked to products—are usually reported through official systems that are slow, limited, and difficult for the public to use. At the same time, millions of people share their experiences openly on social media, including negative health effects from products like cannabis. Until now, most of this information has gone unnoticed by health agencies. We created Waldo, a machine learning tool that can automatically scan large amounts of unstructured text, such as Reddit posts, to identify when people describe possible AEs. Waldo performed with very high accuracy and allowed us to quickly find tens of thousands of potential health concerns in online discussions. We also confirmed that most of the posts Waldo flagged truly reflected adverse events. By making Waldo open-source and freely available, we aim to provide researchers, clinicians, and public health officials with a scalable way to detect safety signals earlier, more efficiently, and in communities that are often overlooked.",https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pdig.0001011,2025-09-30T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0001011.g002&size=inline

RNAtranslator: Modeling protein-conditional RNA design as sequence-to-sequence natural language translation,"Author summary RNA molecules play a vital role in controlling how cells function. Because of their ability to interact with proteins, RNAs are increasingly being explored as therapeutic tools—especially to target proteins that are difficult to treat with traditional drugs. However, designing RNA sequences that can bind to specific proteins is challenging, due to the massive number of possible sequences and the limitations of current laboratory and computer-based methods. In this work, we present a new machine learning approach called RNAtranslator, which treats the design of protein-binding RNAs like translating one language (proteins) into another (RNAs). Using large datasets of known RNA-protein interactions, our model learns how these molecules communicate and can generate RNA sequences that are likely to bind to any given protein—including those never seen before. Unlike existing methods, our approach doesn’t require additional fine-tuning after generation and still achieves high novelty and strong binding potential. This opens the door to designing RNA-based therapeutics more efficiently and for a wider range of diseases.",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1013541,2025-10-03T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013541.g008&size=inline

A mixture of attention experts-embedded flow-based generative model to create synthetic cells in single-cell RNA-Seq datasets,"Author summary Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses focus on identifying distinct cell types and marker genes. Traditional methods face challenges with high dimensionality, sparsity, and sample size imbalances across cell types, limiting automated and unbiased cell-type identification. Generative AI models address these issues by generating synthetic cells for under-represented cell types, preserving biological and contextual relevance, and employing embedding mechanisms to reduce sparsity and dimensionality. We proposed a Flow Based (MAF-FB) model with Masked Affine Autoregressive transform for single-cell synthesis and a new framework that extends vanilla MAF-FB combined with a mixture of experts of attention mechanism (MOE-FB). We compared widely used generative models (Variational Autoencoders, GANs, Gaussian Copula, and ACTIVA with FB models) using integrated pancreatic and additionally external datasets. Synthetic data quality was assessed via multiple discrepancy metrics, a cell type classification task using a Random Forest model, and a ligand-receptor interaction inference task. The FB models, especially MOE-FB showed the highest potential for creating similar and biologically accurate scRNA-seq profiles to the original data. We presented a guideline for automated cell-type identification systems by addressing gaps in single-cell analysis characteristics through the integration of widely used computational biology datasets and implementation of generative models (including a vanilla and a novel, FB model, MAF-FB and MOE-FB frameworks, respectively).",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1013525,2025-10-06T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013525.g007&size=inline

A lightweight deep neural network for personalized detecting ventricular arrhythmias from a single-lead ECG device,"Author summary Ventricular arrhythmias are dangerous irregular heart rhythms that can lead to sudden cardiac death if they are not detected in time. Today, many people carry small, single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) devices that record their heart signals at home or during daily activities. These devices create new opportunities for early warning, but existing computer algorithms often struggle to recognize abnormal rhythms in different people, or even in the same person as their condition changes.We developed a new lightweight deep learning system called MetaVA that learns to “adapt” to each individual quickly. Instead of needing thousands of training samples, the system can adjust itself with only a few labeled heartbeats from the user. We also designed a simple preparation step that helps the model stay accurate even as a person’s heart signals vary over time.In tests on large public databases and a clinical study with a handheld ECG device, our method reached high accuracy while requiring very little computing power. This means MetaVA could be embedded in wearable or portable devices, offering timely, personalized detection of life-threatening arrhythmias in everyday life.",https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pdig.0001037,2025-10-08T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0001037.g005&size=inline

InteracTor: Feature engineering and explainable AI for profiling protein structure-interaction-function relationships,"Author summary InteracTor is a computational toolkit designed to enhance our understanding of protein structure and function by focusing on three-dimensional (3D) structural interactions. Unlike traditional approaches that primarily rely on sequence or secondary structure data, InteracTor extracts biologically meaningful features such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic contacts, which are critical for protein stability and dynamics. By integrating these features into machine learning models alongside Explainable AI methods, InteracTor provides interpretable insights into how specific structural interactions influence protein behavior. Our results demonstrate that tertiary structure features significantly improve the accuracy of protein family classification compared to sequence-based methods alone, underscoring the importance of considering 3D interactions in computational protein analyses. The toolkit’s modular design makes it adaptable for diverse applications, including drug discovery and protein engineering. In a broader context, InteracTor bridges the gap between computational biology and practical applications in medicine and biotechnology by offering a transparent and robust framework for analyzing proteins at a molecular level. This work represents a step forward in leveraging structural data to advance predictive modeling and biological discovery.",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1013038,2025-10-13T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013038.g006&size=inline

Are Machine Learning methods effective in detecting undiagnosed atrial fibrillation in primary care settings using electronic health records? A systematic review,"Author summary: Atrial fibrillation is a common condition that significantly increases the risk of serious health problems such as strokes and heart failure. Despite its impact, it often goes undiagnosed in its early stages due to the lack of reliable clinical tools, leading to thousands of preventable hospitalizations each year. While machine learning has shown potential in improving detection, much of the research has focused on models using electrocardiogram data. In contrast, our review emphasizes the use of electronic health records, a widely available yet underutilized resource in primary care, for automated risk assessment. In this review, we examined how machine learning models based on electronic health records could improve the detection of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation. By using routinely collected health information, we showed that these tools could identify patients at risk earlier and more accurately, enabling timely interventions that improve health outcomes. However, their widespread use is limited by challenges such as inconsistent performance, insufficient testing in diverse real-world settings, and biases in data. Addressing these limitations is crucial to realizing the full potential of this approach. Our review advances the field by synthesizing evidence, identifying critical gaps, and providing a roadmap for future research. By emphasizing robust testing, active collaboration with healthcare providers and patients, and tailoring these tools to primary care needs, our work lays the foundation for making machine learning a trusted and practical solution for early detection of atrial fibrillation.",https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pdig.0001009,2025-10-14T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0001009.g007&size=inline

Predicting in-hospital indicators from wearable-derived signals for cardiovascular and respiratory disease monitoring: An in silico study,"Author summary Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are major global health concerns. Effective remote monitoring is essential for early detection of complications and improved patient care, especially for people with chronic conditions. Wearable devices provide a non-invasive way to track health indicators, but they do not directly measure certain key physiological parameters that doctors typically assess in hospitals. In this study, we explore how machine learning approaches can help bridge this gap. By using virtually-generated data, we trained Gaussian process regression models to estimate critical cardiovascular and respiratory indexes, such as cardiac output and oxygen levels. In particular, we created a virtual population of simulated patients and used their data to train and test our model. Our findings suggest that this approach can be a valuable tool for remote monitoring, providing healthcare professionals with accurate insights, without the need for invasive procedures and enabling earlier detection of complications. However, further testing with real patient data is necessary to fully assess its clinical potential.",https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pdig.0001041,2025-10-14T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0001041.g012&size=inline
Deep learning detection of dynamic exocytosis events in fluorescence TIRF microscopy,"Author summary Until now, deep learning in microscopy has been largely restricted to the detection of static biological objects. Here, we adapted a neural network designed for macromolecule detection in 3D electron microscopy to instead detect dynamic exocytosis events from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, calling it “ExoDeepFinder”. Exocytosis detection is of prime interest because of its involvement in many fundamental physiological processes, from digestive enzyme secretion to neurotransmitter release. Comparing ExoDeepFinder to traditional exocytosis detection methods on a large dataset, we demonstrated the superiority of our deep learning approach. ExoDeepFinder is more robust than other methods, even when faced with experimental conditions unseen during training. Our dataset and method are transparent and freely available, thus enabling re-training and extension for other dynamic cell processes.",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1013556,2025-10-14T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013556.g004&size=inline

Memorization bias impacts modeling of alternative conformational states of solute carrier membrane proteins with methods from deep learning,"Author summary The Solute Carrier (SLC) superfamily of integral membrane proteins transport a wide array of small molecules across plasma and organelle membranes, and function as important drug transporters and as viral receptors. They populate different conformational states during the solute transport process, including outward-open, intermediate (occluded), and inward-open conformational states. While several AI-based protocols for modeling multiple conformational states of proteins have been described recently, these methods are often impacted by “memorization” of one of the alternative conformational states, and do not always provide both the inward- and outward-open conformations of SLC proteins. We describe a combined ESM – template-based-modeling process that relies on the internal pseudo-symmetry of many SLC proteins, to consistently model the alternate conformational states of SLC proteins. We also demonstrate how the resulting multi-state models can be validated by comparison with sequence-based evolutionary co-variance data (ECs). This simple, rapid, and robust approach for modeling conformational landscapes of pseudo-symmetric SLC proteins is demonstrated for several integral membrane protein transporters, including SLC35F2 the receptor of a feline leukemia virus envelope protein required for viral entry into eukaryotic cells.",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1013590,2025-10-17T00:00:00Z,PLOS (Public Library of Science),https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013590.g005&size=inline
