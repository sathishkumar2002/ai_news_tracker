"Tesla Gives Musk $30 Billion Award, Saying ‘Deal Is a Deal’","Tesla Inc. approved an interim stock award worth about $30 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a massive payout meant to keep the billionaire’s attention on the automaker as a legal fight over a 2018 pay package drags on.
The new agreement includes 96 million shares of the automaker that will vest if Musk continues to serve in the top post for another two years, the company said Monday in a regulatory filing. The restricted stock has an exercise price of $23.34, equal to the price in the prior compensation plan.
The move underscores Musk’s grip on the company, even as it struggles with falling electric vehicle sales and a slumping stock price. The world’s richest person has said he wants a greater stake in Tesla as he reorients it around futuristic pursuits including artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles.
