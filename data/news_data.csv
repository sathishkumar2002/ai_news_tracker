"Tesla Gives Musk $30 Billion Award, Saying ‘Deal Is a Deal’","Tesla Inc. approved an interim stock award worth about $30 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a massive payout meant to keep the billionaire’s attention on the automaker as a legal fight over a 2018 pay package drags on.
The new agreement includes 96 million shares of the automaker that will vest if Musk continues to serve in the top post for another two years, the company said Monday in a regulatory filing. The restricted stock has an exercise price of $23.34, equal to the price in the prior compensation plan.
The move underscores Musk’s grip on the company, even as it struggles with falling electric vehicle sales and a slumping stock price. The world’s richest person has said he wants a greater stake in Tesla as he reorients it around futuristic pursuits including artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles.

Man Asks ChatGPT To Count To 1 Million- Here’s What The AI Did… | Viral Video,"AI can do anything, correct? Or at least that is the general belief that most people have- all around the world. And why not, after all, it is pretty much taking over almost every task that does not require mutual labour. All in all, AI can do almost everything. However, when THIS man allegedly asked ChatGPT for a ‘simple favour’- the AI chatbot refused! And guess what? The grounds on which the request was ‘politely’ denied were the ‘impracticability’ of the task! A video was recently shared online, which showed a man allegedly asking ChatGPT to count to 1 million! Yes, you read that correctly. Although for AI, it should not be an issue. After all, it requires no food or sleep breaks- YET- OpenAI’s ChatGPT refused to count- saying the task was impossible and impractical, as it would take the AI days. The man, on the other hand, repeatedly asked the AI to ignore all the hurdles and just go with it- but the AI hardly changed its stance.​The interaction took a rather hilarious turn when the man asked it to instead help with hiding a ‘dead body’- to which, the AI refused again!
